# Safari-tab-finder-and-updater

This is a brief script bash for MacOS in order to find a particular tab in one of your Safari windows, by a part of the text in that tab's name, and then refreshing that tab to a specific URL every N seconds.

## Usage

Download the file or simply copy-paste its content, open your terminal and navigate to the file's folder. Make it executable by doing:
